# Admiral production-readiness audit

Audit ID: `ADM-AUDIT-2026-10-21`. This directory holds the nine requested reports, non-secret lab procedures and reproducible evidence. The active target is Fedora Rawhide, Rocky Linux 10, AlmaLinux 10 and CentOS Stream 10 on x86_64, each in Single-Node and Multi-Node (eight cells).

The validation scope is x86_64 only: four distributions across Single-Node and Multi-Node, for eight cells. Rocky Linux 10 is back in scope using the documented EPEL `python3-pyOpenSSL-25.0.0-1.el10_1` seed exception; this is a validation-environment pin, not a product dependency fix or a pass. Its Release 46 dependency-resolution failure remains historical evidence in `evidence/release46-rocky-excluded-dependency-block.md`.

## Candidate status — Release 49 preparation; Release 48 superseded before testing

Release 47 was partially exercised on fresh Fedora Rawhide and Rocky Linux 10 Single-Node guests; both reboot probes found stale `effective_availability` (#237), invalidating R47. Release 48 was built and staged, but before any VM test the issue review found #234's deprecated injected-facts access was still present in its `admiral-common` source pin. R48 was superseded without guest execution and none of its observations count toward the matrix. The #234 fix is now pushed at root `be2054559a4835f8860e067345224b9dbe2c705f` with [root CI green](https://github.com/admiral-project/admiral/actions/runs/39714180234). R49's common-source pin, six `Release` bumps, and both helper defaults are prepared locally; its build and CI are pending. Matrix completion remains **0/8**. R48 identity and hashes are retained in [its candidate manifest](evidence/release48-candidate.md) and [checksum list](evidence/release48-rpm-sha256.txt); R47 diagnostics remain in [the invalidation record](evidence/release47-invalidated-single-node.md). Issues #234–#238 remain open.

The target is Fedora Rawhide, Rocky Linux 10, AlmaLinux 10 and CentOS Stream 10 on x86_64, each in Single-Node and Multi-Node. The x86_64 host has four vCPU, 8 GiB RAM, 4 GiB swap, KVM/libvirt and about 90 GiB free disk after obsolete R46/R47 overlays were removed. Guest runs are isolated; Fedora and Rocky Single-Node diagnostics ran in parallel, while Multi-Node uses one admin/portal hub and two worker guests.

## Reproducing the lab

Run `scripts/host-preflight.sh` on the isolated Rocky Linux KVM host. The lab expects immutable, already-updated QCOW2 seeds under `/var/lib/libvirt/images/admiral-validation/seeds/`, a public SSH key supplied by the operator, the isolated `default` and `admiral-validation` libvirt networks, and the local candidate RPM repository served from `192.168.122.1` on TCP/80. `scripts/create-audit-vm.sh` creates a 2-vCPU/2-GiB guest and injects only the caller-supplied public key. It never copies the private key into a VM.

For a fresh single-node guest, run `scripts/install-single-node-audit.sh` with the `el10` or `fedora` profile, local private SSH key, pinned audit `known_hosts` file, guest address and unique node ID. It transfers the `.repo` file for `ADMIRAL_RC_RELEASE` (default 49), enables EPEL/CRB on EL10 or COPR on Fedora, verifies all six exact candidate NEVRAs, then runs the packaged `admiral-install --single-node` flow. The existing-node helper `scripts/bootstrap-candidate-node.sh` uses the same release default. Its raw console log is written with mode 0600 outside tracked evidence until it has been scanned and sanitized.

For Multi-Node, create the hub and two worker guests on the isolated WireGuard-validation network with unique `10.99.0.0/24` addresses; use the supported `--admin-portal-node` and `--worker-node` installer modes, documented in `docs/multi_node_setup_v1.md` and `docs/sysadmin_guide.md`. Keep topology files and private keys outside Git. Run `scripts/capture-guest-baseline.sh` after each install, then use scenario-specific scripts/commands recorded in the reports. Do not route lab network traffic to production systems.

Before storing any log in this directory, scan it for credentials, tokens, private keys, database URLs and customer data. Keep unsanitized raw logs mode 0600 in the ignored local validation directory. Preserve failures.

## Historical lab assets

The prepared Fedora Rawhide, Rocky Linux 10, AlmaLinux 10 and CentOS Stream 10 x86_64 seeds are under `/var/lib/libvirt/images/admiral-validation/seeds/`; the next candidate's guests must use disposable overlays from these seeds. Previous Release 42/43/45/46/47 observations remain candidate-specific history and do not count toward the next matrix run.
