# Admiral production-readiness audit

Audit ID: `ADM-AUDIT-2026-10-21`. This directory holds the nine requested reports, non-secret lab procedures and reproducible evidence. The active target is Fedora Rawhide, Rocky Linux 10, AlmaLinux 10 and CentOS Stream 10 on x86_64, each in Single-Node and Multi-Node (eight cells).

The validation scope is x86_64 only: four distributions across Single-Node and Multi-Node, for eight cells. Rocky Linux 10 is back in scope using the documented EPEL `python3-pyOpenSSL-25.0.0-1.el10_1` seed exception; this is a validation-environment pin, not a product dependency fix or a pass. Its Release 46 dependency-resolution failure remains historical evidence in `evidence/release46-rocky-excluded-dependency-block.md`.

## Current candidate status — Release 47

Release 47 is being prepared from the fixes now on `main`; all six Admiral RPM specs are set to Release 47 and their source refs have been checked against component `origin/main`. The coordinated RPM build has not run yet, so Release 47 has no VM results and starts at **0/8**. Release 46's targeted Single-Node probes are historical only and do not carry forward. #229 remains open pending its Multi-Node acceptance check; all other findings must be rerun against this exact package set. Issues [#231](https://github.com/admiral-project/admiral/issues/231) and [#232](https://github.com/admiral-project/admiral/issues/232) track audit-report consistency and the stale installer default.

The Release 47 target is Fedora Rawhide, Rocky Linux 10, AlmaLinux 10 and CentOS Stream 10 on x86_64, each in Single-Node and Multi-Node. The x86_64 host has four vCPU, 8 GiB RAM, 4 GiB swap, KVM/libvirt and more than 80 GiB free disk. Guest runs are isolated and sequential by OS; Multi-Node uses one admin/portal hub and two worker guests.

## Reproducing the lab

Run `scripts/host-preflight.sh` on the isolated Rocky Linux KVM host. The lab expects immutable, already-updated QCOW2 seeds under `/var/lib/libvirt/images/admiral-validation/seeds/`, a public SSH key supplied by the operator, the isolated `default` and `admiral-validation` libvirt networks, and the local candidate RPM repository served from `192.168.122.1` on TCP/80. `scripts/create-audit-vm.sh` creates a 2-vCPU/2-GiB guest and injects only the caller-supplied public key. It never copies the private key into a VM.

For a fresh single-node guest, run `scripts/install-single-node-audit.sh` with the `el10` or `fedora` profile, local private SSH key, pinned audit `known_hosts` file, guest address and unique node ID. It transfers the `.repo` file for `ADMIRAL_RC_RELEASE` (default 47), enables EPEL/CRB on EL10 or COPR on Fedora, verifies all six exact candidate NEVRAs, then runs the packaged `admiral-install --single-node` flow. Its raw console log is written with mode 0600 outside tracked evidence until it has been scanned and sanitized.

For Multi-Node, create the hub and two worker guests on the isolated WireGuard-validation network with unique `10.99.0.0/24` addresses; use the supported `--admin-portal-node` and `--worker-node` installer modes, documented in `docs/multi_node_setup_v1.md` and `docs/sysadmin_guide.md`. Keep topology files and private keys outside Git. Run `scripts/capture-guest-baseline.sh` after each install, then use scenario-specific scripts/commands recorded in the reports. Do not route lab network traffic to production systems.

Before storing any log in this directory, scan it for credentials, tokens, private keys, database URLs and customer data. Keep unsanitized raw logs mode 0600 in the ignored local validation directory. Preserve failures.

## Historical lab assets

The prepared Fedora Rawhide, Rocky Linux 10, AlmaLinux 10 and CentOS Stream 10 x86_64 seeds are under `/var/lib/libvirt/images/admiral-validation/seeds/`; fresh R47 guests must use disposable overlays from these seeds. Previous Release 42/43/45/46 observations remain historical and do not count toward Release 47.
