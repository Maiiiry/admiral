# Evidence directory

## Current candidate

Release 51 is the active candidate. Its six RPMs were built from package-preparation commit `59e6eeb`, all six `%check` stages passed, both isolated local repositories returned HTTP 200, and DNF found exactly the six R51 NEVRAs in each. No R51 VM execution has started, so matrix completion remains **0/8**. Exact source SHAs, CI runs, NEVRAs and hashes are in `release51-candidate.md` and `release51-rpm-sha256.txt`. Issue #244's staged common payload check passed during the R51 build; it remains open for runtime verification. R50 was superseded before VM testing and its build record is retained in `release50-candidate.md`; R49 remains invalidated by #240. Issues remain open; no issue was closed. Rocky's seed pins EPEL `python3-pyOpenSSL` 25.0.0 as a visible environment exception; historical dependency evidence remains in `release46-rocky-excluded-dependency-block.md`.

This directory contains sanitized, non-secret audit artifacts from prior candidates. Source/RPM identity, lab preflight, guest snapshots, seed update results, lifecycle probes, Multi-Node placement and recovery, isolation probes, backups/restores, failure injection, concurrency probes, repository test results, and dependency screening are retained as candidate-specific history. They must not be used as Release 47 PASS evidence. Raw prior RC logs remain ignored because they have not passed a full secret-redaction review.

The Release 43 package manifest and its scoped guest observations are retained as historical evidence in `release43-candidate.md`. They do not validate Release 46.

The prepared seeds were sourced from official GenericCloud images, checked against official SHA-256 manifests, updated with `dnf -y update`, booted once with the updated kernel, and shut down cleanly. Source image SHA-256 values recorded during this preparation:
